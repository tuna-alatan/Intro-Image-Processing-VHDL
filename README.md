# Introduction to Image Processing Using VHDL

This repositry containts code that is developed through my 3-week internship
conducted at Artron Inc.. The motivation of the intership was to gain experience using VHDL while trying to implement some basic image processing algorithms. More detailed information about the project can be found in the [project_report](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16919771/Project_Report.pdf).
